# Relation to WBS

WBS comprises three interlocking components: **What** (intent/space), **Boundaries** (hard constraints that _eliminate_ invalid solutions), and **Success** (criteria that are **necessary and sufficient**). DSpec maps directly onto this: Level‑0 captures the **What** and the domain **Boundaries** (as invariants and their demands) without mechanism; later levels commit to designs and verifications.
