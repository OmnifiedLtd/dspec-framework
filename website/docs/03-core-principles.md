# Core Principles

1. **Separate meaning from mechanism.** Level‑0 records **facts, lifecycles, invariants** and **consistency demands**; Level‑1 chooses **consistency groups**, **commands**, and **mechanisms**; Level‑2 binds to technology.
2. **Progressive constraint.** Each level narrows the solution space while keeping earlier layers stable—exactly the WBS move from **What** → **Boundaries** → **Success**.
3. **Deterministic validation.** Success criteria at each level are _necessary & sufficient_; anything meeting them is valid, and anything valid must meet them.
4. **Composability & traceability.** Domain artifacts are shared; features reference only what they need.
