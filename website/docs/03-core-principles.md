# Core Principles

1. **Truly Declarative Specs:** Designed to drive software development and get deterministic results.
2. **Progressive constraint.** Each level narrows the solution space while keeping earlier layers stable.
3. **Separate meaning from mechanism.** Start with the domain, progress through design, architecture and finally bind to technology.
4. **Deterministic validation.** Success criteria at each level are _necessary & sufficient_; anything meeting them is valid, and anything valid must meet them.
5. **Composability & traceability.** Domain artifacts are shared; features reference only what they need.
