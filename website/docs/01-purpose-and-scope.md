# Purpose & Scope

DSpec lets teams describe features in **short, declarative specs** that are readable by humans and consumable by tools and in particular, by AI Agents. Specs progressively constrain the solution space—from business intent (Level‑0) to design (Level‑1) and then to concrete technology (Level‑2)—**without** polluting earlier layers with implementation details.

Problem:
With the new power of AI-agentic workflows, software is more and more being driven by markdown based specifications. These specifications
have hugely varying strucuture and are extremely lengthy. Usually as a result people don't read them.
Solution:
Provide a structured, opinionated way of describing software via concise, human-readable specifications with a predicable structure.
