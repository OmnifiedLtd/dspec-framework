# Purpose & Scope

DSpec lets teams describe features in **short, declarative specs** that are readable by humans and consumable by tools and in particular, by AI Agents. Specs progressively constrain the solution space—from business intent (Level‑0) to design (Level‑1) and then to concrete technology (Level‑2)—**without** polluting earlier layers with implementation details.

- Preserve **domain meaning** at Level‑0.
- Apply **constructive constraints** to reduce the solution space before building.
- Define **necessary & sufficient** success criteria so validity is checkable, not subjective.
