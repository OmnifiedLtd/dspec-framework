# Relation to WBS

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a foundational project management technique that decomposes a project into smaller, more manageable components. While traditionally focused on project deliverables, the WBS framework extends beyond mere tasks, focusing on three interlocking components: **What** (intent/space), **Boundaries** (hard constraints that _eliminate_ invalid solutions), and **Success** (criteria that are **necessary and sufficient**).

DSpec maps directly onto this: Level‑0 captures the **What** and the domain **Boundaries** (as invariants and their demands) without mechanism; later levels commit to designs and verifications.

For a deeper dive into the WBS framework, you can refer to [this article](https://chrisbora.substack.com/p/wbs-framework).

Furthermore, the authors of the DSpec framework have observed "Bora's Law" firsthand when developing software with AI agents. This principle suggests that intelligence scales with constraint. We believe that explicitly defining precise constraints and boundaries at Level-0 is crucial for effectively guiding AI agents, leading to more predictable and higher-quality outcomes.
